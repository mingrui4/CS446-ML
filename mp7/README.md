# Assignment 7: Linear MRF for Image Denoising.
In this exercise will build a structured prediction model that, given several noisy samples ^I of some image I, learns a model that attempts to recover the image I. To simplify the problem, we will be representing each pixel of the images as binary values {0, 1}.
