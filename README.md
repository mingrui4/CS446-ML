# CS446-machine learning course project
MP1: Intro to Tensorflow---Implement code that creates a few basic computation graphs and then executes them.

MP2: Linear Model---Build a system to predict housing prices used linear regression.

MP3: Logistic Model---Build a logistic model based binary classifier that can separate two-class audio datasets

MP4: SVM---Build a system to classify between gray-scale and color images using a SVM

MP5: Multiclass SVM---Use SVM to recognize handwritten digits. 

MP6: Deep Net---Implement the deep net from the written section and train it using stochastic gradient descent.

MP7: Linear MRF for Image Denoising

MP8: K-Means---Cluster iris data.

MP9: GMM---Implement and fit a Gaussian mixture model to the MNIST dataset to predict the digit label given an image.

MP10: VAE---Generate images from the data distribution using VAE

MP11: GAN---Learn the distribution of the MNIST dataset and generate images that resemble the original ones

MP12: Q-learning---Train an AI agent to play the Pong game using Q-learning.
